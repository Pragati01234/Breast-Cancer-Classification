# Breast-Cancer-Classification


Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer and is causing a huge number of deaths in women. The high incidence and mortality of breast cancer is due to its considerably low accuracy of diagnosis. In this paper, we explore machine learning models that can be applied to help increasing the accuracy of the diagnosis of breast cancer. The main problem of the project is to detect breast cancer based on a set of features calculated from a digitized image of the Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) of a breast mass from a patient.
